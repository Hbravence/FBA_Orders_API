# Java Seller API Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **serverless pipeline** using **AWS Lambda** to extract and store Amazon's Seller API data in **S3**, designed as a technical exploration of cloud-based automation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Java** – Backend logic and API interactions  
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless function for data extraction  
- **AWS S3** – Cloud storage for structured data  
- **Seller API** – Data source for eCommerce transactions  

## 🔍 **Challenges Faced**
- **API Rate Limits & Optimization** – Had to adjust request intervals to prevent excessive API calls.
- **Serverless Debugging Complexity** – Debugging AWS Lambda functions remotely required additional logging and monitoring setup.
- **Iterative Architecture Refinement** – Experimented with multiple versions before settling on an efficient design.

## 💡 **Key Learnings**
- **AWS Lambda Execution Flow** – Improved understanding of serverless architecture and event-driven computing.
- **API Data Handling & Storage** – Learned how to efficiently process and store API data in AWS S3.
- **Scalability Considerations** – Built a serverless system that can scale without manual intervention.
- **Resilience in Project Development** – Gained experience troubleshooting roadblocks and pivoting when necessary.

  # **Future Improvements**

## 🚀 **Potential Enhancements**
- **Data Processing in Python** – Integrate predictive analytics by transforming raw API data into actionable insights.
- **Front-End Dashboard Integration** – Explore adding a React or Flask-based interface for data visualization.
